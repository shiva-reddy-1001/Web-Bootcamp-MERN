For Bank and financial related companies , you need to have some knowledge in this field like for Std Chartered u will need to know concepts of GST, Taxation, Currency conversions etc. It requires u to be really fast in calculations. Practice some puzzles from gfg. I would suggest for interviews u can form a small group with ur friends and interview each other.
Generally in technical rounds, Data structures like arrays, string, stack, queues are focused on along with ur projects. Be confident and keep answers short. Do not brag about something too much, they do not like it
