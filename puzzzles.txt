1. 45 min from 2 60 min wires : burn one from 2 end
2. find daughters age, prod = 72, sum=14, ans= 3,3,8
3. bee and trains : u = 50 km/hr
v = 70 km/hr
d = 100 km
b = 80 km/hr

Therfore, the total distance travelled by bee 
= b*d/(u+v) 
= 80 * 100/(50+70) 
= 66.67 km (approx)

7. Contaminated pills : 
To find the contaminated Jar, follow this step-wise approach.

Step 1: Take out 1 pill from jar 1, 2 pills from jar 2, 3 pills from jar 3, 4 pills from jar 4 and 5 pills from jar 5.
Step 2: Put all these 15 pills on the scale. The correct weight is 150 (15*10). But one of the jars has contaminated pills. So the weight will definitely be less than 150.
Step 3: If the weight is 149 then jar 1 has contaminated pills because there is only one contaminated pill. If the weight is 148 then jar 2, if the weight is 147 then jar 3, if 146 then jar 4, if 145 then jar 5.
